# DhonVeli API
This is an API for the DhonVeli web application that we developed for our Distributed Enterprise Software Development module in the 3rd year of our BSC in Computer Science.

## How to setup the API
- Install the libraries in `requirements.txt` with the following command

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

- Create a `.env` file and write down the database connection URL according to the following template

``DB_URL = "mysql+pymysql://username:password@host/database"``
